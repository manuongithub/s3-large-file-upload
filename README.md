# s3-large-file-upload

**Step-by-Step Setup**

**1. Install Required Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

	npm install

**2. Configure AWS Credentials**

Update the server.js file with your AWS credentials and bucket details. Replace the placeholders with your actual AWS credentials and bucket details:
	

 - region
   
  - accessKeyId
   
  - secretAccessKey
   
   - bucket
 
 **3. Run the Backend Server**

Start the backend server:

	node server.js

This will start the backend server on port 3000.

**4. Set Up the Frontend Server**

Ensure you have a simple HTTP server to serve the frontend files. You can use http-server for this:

Install http-server globally if you haven't already:

	npm install -g http-server

Navigate to the project directory and start the HTTP server:

	http-server

By default, http-server will start serving files on port 8080.

**5. Test the Application**

Open your browser and navigate to  [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)  (or  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)). You should see the upload interface with a file input and an upload button.

 - Select a large video file using the file input.
   
  - Click the upload button.

The file will be split into chunks and uploaded to your S3 bucket using the signed URLs generated by the backend server.

**Notes**

 - Ensure your S3 bucket has the appropriate CORS configuration to allow
   the necessary operations from your frontend.
   
  - Monitor the console for any errors or progress updates during the
   upload process.
   
   - Verify the uploaded file in your S3 bucket to ensure it is properly
   uploaded and accessible.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run the large file upload system successfully.
